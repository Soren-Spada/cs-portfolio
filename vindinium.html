<h2>
    Vindinium is a turn based 4 player game which runs on the input of the players' various computor programming languages. The objective of the game is to collect the most gold. Gold is collected by obtaining mines and holding them. The game is starts when each player is given a random color bot and then are placed on a randomized map. Each map has 3 parts. Obstacles, which play no role other than to add a wall a player must walk around, mines, which players need to collect, and taverns, which recovers a player's hit points. Each player starts with 100 hit points. Every turn the player moves they lose 1 hit point. Every mine the player captures they lose 20 hit points. If a player attacks another player they lose 20 hit points. If one player dies, his mines go to the person that attacked and killed him. Every 4 turns, a full rotation of 1 turn per person, 1 gold per mine goes to person that ownes them. After 1,200 rounds, the game ends with the winner having the most gold.
