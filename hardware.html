<p id="monitor-p">
    When I was a child I used to call the monitor, the "computer." However, this thing I called a computer, is actually just a screen illuminated with light that shows the results of the processes that have been run by the components of the motherboard. So yes, the screen that is flashing before you is a monitor.
